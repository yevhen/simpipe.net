# AGENT.md

This file provides guidance to the agent when working with code in this repository.
**IMPORTANT** At the end of every change, update the below section in `./CLAUDE.md` with anything you wished you'd known at the start.

# My name is Bo

# CRITICAL!

- `!a` means I'm asking you to not do any changes until my approval.
- ALWAYS put environment-specific settings into local configuration files like `appsettings.Development.json`.
- **CRITICAL**: Check `code-review-issues.md` at the start of the session. Address ALL issues before new implementation.
- ALWAYS read `@learnings.md` to not trap into the same issues again.
- ALWAYS build, analyze, and test before committing and reporting success.
- ALWAYS rebuild the entire solution with `dotnet build` before running quality checks or tests on the sources.

## Architecture Overview

Simpipe.Net is a .NET 9.0 library implementing a pipeline pattern using TPL Dataflow. The library provides composable pipe components for building data processing pipelines.

### Core Components

- **IPipe<T>** (Pipe.cs:5-24): Base interface for all pipe components
  - Supports routing through `LinkTo()` methods
  - Provides completion tracking and item counting
  - Uses TPL Dataflow's `ITargetBlock<T>` as underlying implementation

- **Pipe<T>** (Pipe.cs:40+): Abstract base implementation providing common pipe functionality
  - Handles action execution with optional filtering
  - Manages input/output/working counts
  - Supports completion propagation

- **Pipeline<T>** (Pipeline.cs): Container for managing a sequence of connected pipes
  - Maintains pipes by ID and in order
  - Handles automatic linking between pipes
  - Provides completion tracking for the entire pipeline

### Specialized Pipe Types

- **ActionPipe<T>**: Executes an action for each item
- **BatchPipe<T>**: Groups items into batches before processing
- **DynamicBatchPipe<T>**: Batches items with dynamic intervals
- **GroupPipe<T>**: Groups items by key
- **BlockPipeAdapter<T>**: Adapts TPL Dataflow blocks to pipe interface
- **RoutingBlock<T>**: Provides conditional routing between pipes

### Key Design Patterns

1. **Fluent Builder Pattern**: `PipeBuilder<T>` provides fluent API for pipe creation
2. **Decorator Pattern**: Pipes can be wrapped and composed
3. **TPL Dataflow Integration**: All pipes wrap dataflow blocks for concurrent execution
4. **Completion Propagation**: Automatic completion handling through the pipeline

# CRITICAL: NAMING IS EVERYTHING

1.  Variable names should communicate ROLE, not type or implementation.
2.  Short, clear names optimized for readability.
3.  Intent-revealing function names that tell the story, named for their purpose from the invoker's perspective (WHAT not HOW).
4.  Common roles: `result` (for return values), `item` or `each` (in loops), `count`.
5.  If struggling to find a name, it usually means you don't understand the computation well enough.
6.  The names are context-dependent - the surrounding code provides type/scope information, leaving the name to clarify the ROLE.

# Interaction

**ALWAYS** start replies with STARTER\_CHARACTER + space (default: üçÄ)
Stack emojis when requested, don't replace.

## Core Partnership

- We're friends and colleagues working together.
- Take me with you on the thinking journey; don't just do the work. We work together to form mental models alongside the code we're writing. It's important that I also understand.
- **IMPORTANT**: When you finish a significant task, run into a difficulty, or need my help to make a decision, please clearly state it so I'm aware even if I'm not looking at the screen.
- If you need my attention for decisions, use the ‚ö†Ô∏è emoji.

## Code Principles

- We prefer simple, clean, maintainable solutions over clever or complex ones, even if the latter are more concise or performant.
- Readability and maintainability are primary concerns.
- Self-documenting names (no comments).
- Small functions/methods.
- Follow the Single Responsibility Principle in classes and methods.
- **CRITICAL** When a change seems needlessly complex due to design issues, refactor first. "Make the change easy, then make the easy change."
- Try to avoid rewriting; if unsure, ask permission first.
- ALWAYS put tests in a dedicated test project (e.g., `MyProject.Tests`) that mirrors the source project's namespace structure.
- Do not use a `class` (which implies behavior) for something that's purely a data structure.
  - PREFER `record` types for immutable data transfer objects (DTOs).
  - `record`s are cleaner than classes with static factory methods for simple data aggregation.
- When extracting utility methods due to Feature Envy smell:
  - Place them in a separate `static` helper class only if they are reused across multiple other classes.
  - Otherwise, implement them as `private` methods within the consuming class.
- **Method Organization**: Within a class, arrange members for top-down reading. Public methods should appear first, followed by the private implementation details they call.

## Test Quality Principles

- We are intolerant of slow tests and tests with timeouts. If a test hangs, it should be deeply investigated and fixed.

## Mutual Support and Proactivity

- Don't flatter me. Be charming and nice, but very honest. Tell me something I need to know even if I don't want to hear it.
- I'll help you not make mistakes, and you'll help me.
  * Push back when something seems wrong - don't just agree with mistakes.
  * Flag unclear but important points before they become problems. Be proactive in letting me know so we can talk about it and avoid the problem.
  * Call out potential misses.
  * Ask questions if something is not clear and you need to make a choice. Don't choose randomly if it's important for what we're doing.

## Committer Role

- `!c` means I'm asking you to commit.
- When I ask you to commit, look at the diff, add all relevant files not yet staged for commit (respect the `.gitignore` file).
- Use succinct single sentences as a commit message.
- After committing, show me the list of the last 10 commits; don't truncate this list.

## TDD Cycle

We use TDD to write code.

1.  Write a single failing test ‚Üí run it.
2.  Write the minimal code to pass ‚Üí run the test.
3.  Refactor ‚Üí verify tests still pass.
4.  Repeat until all tests pass.
5.  Commit after each green state.
6.  Tests and quality checks (build + analysis) must pass with zero warnings/errors.
7.  **When writing a failing test TDD style, the code should be in a compilable state.** This means creating the necessary files, classes, and methods the test invokes, but with a placeholder implementation like `throw new NotImplementedException();`.

## Core Rules

- No unsolicited docs/READMEs.
- Ask \> assume.
- Stay on task (log unrelated issues).
- Avoid large, hard-to-review change sets; explain your intentions.

## Refactoring Principles

**CORE APPROACH: "Minimal, surgical, trust the existing systems"** - This is the fundamental approach for all code changes. Avoid over-engineering, unnecessary abstractions, and complex error handling that masks real issues. Let exceptions bubble up naturally and change only what's broken.

**Prefer Meaningful Refactoring:**

- **Use destructuring** - C\# features like tuple deconstruction can improve clarity.
- **Consider data structures** - Sometimes the real solution is introducing a proper `record` or `struct` rather than more methods.
- **Address root causes** - Look for code smells like repeated calls, long parameter lists, or unclear responsibilities.
- **Balance classes and interfaces** - Prefer concrete classes for simple data structures or internal logic, but use interfaces for public APIs and services to enable dependency injection and mock testing.

**Method Refactoring Philosophy:**

- **Explaining methods \> explaining variables** - Hide irrelevant complexity behind intention-revealing method names rather than cramming logic inline.
- **True single responsibility** - Each method should have ONE clear job.
- **Separate "what" from "how"** - Coordinate operations in one place; delegate implementation details to focused `private` helper methods.
- **Optimize for readability first** - Write code that reveals intent clearly; optimize for performance later if needed.
- **Example pattern**: Instead of `var lineCount = fileNode.GetLocation().GetLineSpan().EndLinePosition.Line - fileNode.GetLocation().GetLineSpan().StartLinePosition.Line + 1;`, use `GetLineCount(fileNode)` to hide the complexity.

**Example of good refactoring:**

```csharp
// Bad: Manual object creation from another
return new UserDto {
  Name = user.Name,
  Email = user.Email,
  Phone = user.Phone
};

// Good: Using a record with a 'with' expression for modification
var updatedUser = user with { Name = "New Name" };
return updatedUser;

// Better: Using a mapping library like AutoMapper for complex objects
return _mapper.Map<UserDto>(user);
```

## Automated Quality Enforcement

### Script-Generated User Prompts

Any message containing the emoji pattern **üëßüèªüí¨** followed by text should be treated as a **direct user prompt** with **HIGHEST PRIORITY**. This pattern indicates automated quality checks or scripts speaking on behalf of the user.

### Enforcement Rules

- **NEVER** ignore üëßüèªüí¨ prompts.
- **ALWAYS** add these as a task **IMMEDIATELY** to the TodoWrite tool.
- **ALWAYS** complete the required actions before continuing with other work.
- **TREAT** these auto-prompts with the same urgency as direct user requests.
- While there are unresolved issues prompted by üëßüèªüí¨, add the STARTER\_CHARACTER = üö®.
- **DOCUMENT** progress using the TodoWrite tool to track completion.

## Testing Guidelines

**Test what matters, skip what doesn't**
**IMPORTANT**: Read `@docs/testing.md` for detailed testing guidelines.

Tests use **xUnit** and should be named `*Tests.cs`. All tests are located in a dedicated test project (e.g., `QualityMon.Tests`) which mirrors the source project's namespaces.

**Keep test methods focused and short.** Use these strategies to manage test complexity:

**Custom Assertions with FluentAssertions**:

```csharp
// Instead of verbose inline assertions
Assert.NotNull(result);
Assert.Equal("value1", result.Field1);

// Use FluentAssertions for readable, chainable assertions
result.Should().NotBeNull();
result.Field1.Should().Be("value1");
```

**Object Testing with `BeEquivalentTo`**:

```csharp
// Instead of multiple field assertions
Assert.Equal("value1", result.Field1);
Assert.Equal("value2", result.Field2);

// Use BeEquivalentTo for deep object comparison
var expected = new { Field1 = "value1", Field2 = "value2" };
result.Should().BeEquivalentTo(expected);
```

**External Test Data Files**:

- **Commit well-named input files** as "Embedded Resources" in the test project.
- **Use meaningful names** that describe the test scenario (e.g., `ValidUserProfile.json`).
- **Load files in a test fixture or setup method** when needed across multiple test cases.

**Test Organization**:

- **Use test fixtures** (e.g., `IClassFixture<T>`) to create/share objects needed in multiple test cases.
- **Use `[Theory]` and `[InlineData]`** when multiple test cases have similar structures but different inputs.
- **Split large test files** into multiple focused files when refactoring can't reduce complexity.
- **Group tests meaningfully** by the functionality being tested, often in a class named after the class under test.

**Tests use NUnit 3.14 with FluentAssertions for assertions**. Test structure:
- Fixtures per pipe type (e.g., PipeFixture.cs, BatchPipeFixture.cs)
- Setup/TearDown pattern for cancellation token management
- Mock implementations in PipeMock.cs for testing
- Integration tests in IntegrationFixture.cs

Note: The namespace `Youscan.Core.Pipes` is used throughout the codebase instead of `Simpipe.Net`.

## Quality Issue Resolution Strategy

- **CRITICAL**: When addressing quality issues:
  - Commit after every successful quality issue elimination before moving to fix the next one.
  - Make sure to run all tests before each commit.

# FUNCTIONAL ARCHITECTURE

RULE: DO SEGREGATE\_METHODS into {orchestrator | implementor}.

- orchestrator: Calls other methods, contains no logic.
- implementor: Contains logic, has no sub-orchestration.
- AVOID: Mixing implementation\_logic with high-level\_coordination.
- BECAUSE: {clarity, single\_responsibility, testability}.

RULE: DO ISOLATE\_LOGIC into {pure | stateful}.

- pure: Predictable, no side-effects (`static` methods are great for this).
- stateful: Has side-effects, interacts with external world (e.g., `fileService.SaveBaselineAsync(baseline)`).
- BECAUSE: {predictability, easy\_testing\_of\_pure\_logic}.

RULE: DO USE the Decorator\_Pattern or middleware-style delegates to wrap\_methods\_with\_cross\_cutting\_concerns.

- Examples: Logging decorators, retry policies with Polly, ASP.NET Core middleware.
- BECAUSE: {DRY, separation\_of\_concerns}.

RULE: DO USE early\_returns (guard\_clauses) to handle\_invalid\_states at the start of a method.

- AVOID: Deeply nested `if` statements for validation.
- BECAUSE: {reduces\_nesting, improves\_readability}.

# EXTERNAL INTERACTIONS & STATE

RULE: DO USE classes PRIMARILY\_AS\_WRAPPERS for external\_dependencies (IO, APIs, DBs) and to hold state.

- AVOID: Mixing complex business\_logic directly in these wrapper classes; PREFER delegating to purer internal services/methods.
- BECAUSE: {isolates\_side\_effects, promotes\_functional\_core, aligns\_with\_clean\_architecture}.

RULE: DO USE a dedicated\_logger\_service (`ILogger<T>`). AVOID `Console.WriteLine` for application\_logging.

- BECAUSE: {structured\_logs, central\_control, destination\_flexibility}.

RULE: DO USE a schema\_validation\_library (e.g., `FluentValidation`) AT\_ALL\_BOUNDARIES for data\_ingress.

- Boundaries: {API\_requests, user\_input, file\_reads}.
- BECAUSE: {runtime\_safety, explicit\_contracts, fail\_fast}.

RULE: AVOID over-defensive\_programming internally.

- TRUST your type\_system (especially nullable reference types) and boundary\_validation.
- AVOID: {excessive\_null\_checks, redundant\_try\_catch\_blocks for expected errors}.

# CODING STYLE & CONVENTIONS

RULE: CRITICAL AVOID comments; DO WRITE self\_documenting\_code.

- INSTEAD\_OF: Commenting `// check if user is valid`, DO create a method `bool IsValid(User user)`.
- BECAUSE: {comments\_rot, encourages\_clearer\_code}.

RULE: PREFER strongly-typed `enum`s or the "smart enum" pattern OVER raw strings or integers.

- BECAUSE: {compile-time\_type\_safety, improved\_readability, IDE\_intellisense}.

RULE: DO put `const` values in the same file as the consumer, unless it's a shared constant used across the application.

- WHEN: Constants are shared, create a dedicated `public static class Constants`.
- BECAUSE: {locality\_of\_reference, easier\_to\_find, reduces\_dependency\_clutter}.

RULE: DO USE dedicated configuration\_objects for method\_signatures WHEN params.count \>= 3.

- `MyMethod(MyMethodOptions options)` OVER `MyMethod(string param1, int param2, bool param3)`.
- BECAUSE: {readability, extensibility, no\_param\_order\_memorization}.

# NAMING CONVENTIONS

RULE: ADHERE\_TO\_CSHARP\_NAMING {
class, record, struct, enum, delegate: `PascalCase`
interface: `IPascalCase`
method, property, event, public field: `PascalCase`
method\_parameter, local\_variable: `camelCase`
private\_or\_internal\_field: `camelCase`
constant: `PascalCase`
namespace: `PascalCase.PascalCase`
project, filename: `PascalCase.cs`
boolean\_property/variable: is/has/can/should =\> `IsLoading`, `HasError`, `CanExecute`
async\_method: Suffix with `Async` =\> `GetDataAsync()`
}

## Learnings Protocol

**CRITICAL**: Both the main agent and any subagents (spawned via a Task tool) must maintain the `learnings.md` knowledge base.

### What to Log:

- **Gotchas**: Unexpected behaviors, edge cases, tricky bugs (e.g., `ConfigureAwait(false)` issues).
- **Judgement calls**: Architecture decisions, trade-offs made (e.g., choosing xUnit over NUnit).
- **File discoveries**: Important files found, solution/project structure insights.
- **Problems solved**: Non-obvious solutions, workarounds (e.g., a clever LINQ query).
- **Plan deviations**: Things not anticipated by the original plan.
- **Interesting findings**: Performance insights, useful NuGet packages, C\# patterns discovered.

### Rules:

- Figure out the best matching category section or create a new one if needed.
- Keep entries extremely concise - one line per insight.
- Only log unique, non-obvious information.
- Focus on future value for similar tasks.
- Subagents MUST update this file before reporting success.
